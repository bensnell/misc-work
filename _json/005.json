	"description" : "Dio is the name of my computer. I trained it to study classical sculpture, then asked it to close its eyes and dream of a new sculpture—one which has never before been seen. Then, I ground Dio to dust and re-formed it into its dream. This sculpture is both the computer and the computer’s dream.\n\nFollowing in the lineage of Robert Morris’ <i>Box with the Sound of Its Own Making</i>, this piece holds in balance two disparate realities: the beingness and coming-to-beingness of an object. On one hand, this mass bears an evident tactility in the bits of silicon, copper, steel and plastic that comprise the machine. On the other, traces of the computer’s invisible processing power live on in its bodily form and in the bits of matter containing its thoughts and memories. Endowed is a materiality upon the impossibly immaterial.\n\nWhereas the classics worked in stone and bronze, so too is the material I use distinctly of my time: the raw material of computers.",
