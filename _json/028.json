Rarely is the pre- and post- state visible at once.\n\nHere, two objects—a rock and a clock—each hold in balance their beingness and coming-to-beingness with impossible material gradients: divergent materialities between real and nonreal, product and process.\n\nAs a series, these pieces visualize the 'presence of absence'—the voids left behind by natural entropic processes of decay and destruction.",
