	"description" : "These are a series of experiments in generative sketching using BZ-Reactions, Braitenberg Vehicles and Boids. The systems are built using simple rules, from which emerge more complex behaviors. They were developed from scratch in C++ (OpenFrameworks). System details are included below each video.",
