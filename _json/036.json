	"description" : "I designed intricate lattice-like wraparound bracelets in Rhino, considering printability and the material qualities of photosensitive resin.\n\nOne piece bracelets must have enough flexibility to bend onto the wrist. After many tests of micro- and macro- geometries, these two designs resulted. With each, the overall structure wraps comfortably while the lattice diamonds bend just enough to afford global deformations without breaking.",
