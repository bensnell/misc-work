In this demo, the robot, in a wary state, appears to draw away from each touch.\n\nThis project is an exploration of what it means to become intimately personal with a robot. When they can feel a feather brush against their arm or a drop of rain land on their hand, how do their agencies change? How would we interact with robots differently when they feel us the same way we feel them?",
