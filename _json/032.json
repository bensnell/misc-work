	"description" : "<a href='http://flong.com/archive/projects/augmented-hand-series/index.html' target='blank'>Augmented Hand Series</a> is an interactive art piece by New Media Artist, Golan Levin, that augments users' hands in real time to remove a finger, add an extra finger or two, etc. I designed and fabricated wood enclosures for three more editions of the piece.\n\nWith previous enclosures, users pulled out cords and knocked sensors out of alignment. So, with this iteration I carefully considered all possible pain points and designed a kid-proof enclosure and electronics mounts to contain the embedded camera, Leap Motion, Makey Makey, lightpad, LED strips, buttons, and display.\n\nThis design flat-packs to allow for easy transport. A service door on the backside affords technicians convenient access to all components. Most importantly, I wanted the device to be approachable, so I designed the opening into which the hand is placed to have its edges rounded-up, much like a smile.",
