	"description" : "Carved out of a block of cherry wood using a CNC 5 axis router and Fusion360, this object was 3D scanned from a boar's vertebre.\n\nThis self-directed project pushes the capabilities of the CNC machine to the max. Careful planning of toolpaths keeps too much material from being removed at a time, allowing even the thinnest of features to remain intact.\n\n<i>Made in Autodesk's <a href='https://www.autodesktechnologycenters.com/' target='blank'>Artist Residency</a> at Pier 9.</i>",
