	"description" : "Jenny, a computer, is tasked with extracting the morphological essence of Greek and Roman sculpture. For every sculpture it sees, it tries to distill it into its most basic components. In doing so, it defines its own visual vocabulary, then speaks in it. These are the first utterances of such a language. They are the dreams of a machineâ€”one that has learned to <i>see</i> in sculpture.\n\nIn this learning process, representational sculptures by the likes of Michelangelo and Donatello become untraceably authorless. Just as the digital realm is authorless, so too are the sculptures: belonging to no one and everyone at the same time.\n\nWith such resemblance to sculpures of Brancusi, Arp and Moore, these sculptures begin to question the creative capacities of the machine. However, doing so means giving up a small bit of our humanity.",
