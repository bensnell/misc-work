	"description" : "LIDAR is a range-sensing technology typically employed by the government and military to survey land from above. By measuring the time of flight of modulated pulses of light, depth can be extracted from a scene, often to very high precision.\n\nFrom surreptitiously slit-scanning streets packed with bar-goers at 2 in the morning to arresting the beauty of bamboo forests in northern Virginia with handmade rigs, Iâ€™ve continued to have a conversation with this piece of technology in hopes of exploring how it sees the world.\n\nThe artifacts produced through the process of capture, including the bounce of my gait, the elongation or compression of figures, the casting of shadows and the existence of black holes, reveal a deep interconnectedness between observer and observed.\n\nEach of the videos here represent a capture or series of captures. Specific processes are described in further detail below each.\n\n. . .\n\n<i>Recording and rendering possible with custom software I built in C++ (OpenFrameworks).\n\nMany thanks to Golan Levin and Dan Moore (for his <a href='https://github.com/danzeeeman/ofxUrg' target='blank'>ofxURG</a> addon).</i>",

The large black hole in the center represents the 'blind spot' of the sensor. Each capture is comrpised of hundreds of linear scans, stacked together into a spherical scan.",
		"152925908" : "<i>Sleeping</i>. Here, a single night of sleep is compressed into thirteen seconds. This timelapse is built from five hundred individual spherical frames. During capture, the LIDAR remains stationary, but the camera's movement is set in post-production.",
		"153359075" : "<i>Cafe</i>. A LIDAR timelapse captures the afternoon happenings in a cafe. Notice how people cast shadows in the same way a single flame would light the walls.",
		"144993841" : "<i>Southside Alleys</i>. Attaching the LIDAR device to my car and driving through alleys at night produces these ominous slit-scanned time-scapes. Buildings, trees, cars and fire hydrants are visible as series of stacked outlines. Each line represents a single linear scan.",
		"145215259" : "<i>Carson Street</i>. This slit-scan is produced by hiding the LIDAR in my backpack and walking down a street packed with people in the early morning. Bodies appear elongated at times and compressed at others, depending on whether they were walking with or against me, respectively.",
		"151335007" : "<i>Temporalized Hallway</i>. This capture was made in collaboration with the Carnegie Museum of Art. These scans were taken in a hallway, with people walking in both directions. However, everyone faces the same direction in the scan. This is because we all walk forwards, not backwards, in time.",
