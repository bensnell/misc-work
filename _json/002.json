It's assembled without screws, nails or glue and can easily flat-pack into a 1.5' x 8' sheet three inches thick.\n\nThis project is the culmination of extended explorations into efficient furniture production and assembly methods.\n\n<i>Collaboration with <a href='http://www.evanfinkle.com/' target='blank'>Evan Finkle</a></i>",
